# onePieceDex
A simple image detector that scans images and compares them against a model, the program can scan either Luffy, Zoro or Sanji from the anime one piece, this was created by following the tutorial on https://www.pyimagesearch.com/2018/04/16/keras-and-convolutional-neural-networks-cnns/ this was only used for educational purposes

to use the dex, type into the cmd when in the onePieceDetector file python classify.py --model onePieceDex.model --labelbin lb.pickle --image examples/*choose example image here*

there are 7 example images in the example folder, two for luffy, two for sanji and two for zoro and also one of me for good measure

in this project i used tensowflow, openCV and keras mainly
